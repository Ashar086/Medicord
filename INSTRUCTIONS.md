## ❓ How to Use (Phase 1, v0.1)

Make sure you already have the Backend API running on your local machine or on a server. You can find the backend API [here](https://github.com/abdibrokhim/BrAIn-MRI-App-Api) and follow the instructions written in the [README.md](https://github.com/abdibrokhim/BrAIn-MRI-App-Api/blob/main/README.md).

After running the app, you can either sign in with the following credentials (if you need pre-populated data like patients, observations, etc.):

```
email: testO1@gmail.com
password: testO1@gmail.com
```

Or you can create a new account and sign in.

Once you have created an account, you can start exploring BrAIn MRI's features.

### 🆕 Register New Patient

To register a new patient, you need to enter the patient's full name and date of birth.

### 📝 Fill Out the Form with Patient Brain MRI Details

After registering a new patient, you can fill out the form with patient Brain MRI details, such as scanning technique, orbital cones shape, etc.

### 🧠 Generate Diagnostic Conclusion

After filling out the form, you can generate a diagnostic conclusion using our predictive model. In case you are not satisfied with the conclusion, you can re-generate it.

### ✅ Validate the Diagnostic Conclusion

Next, validate the diagnostic conclusion, after which it will be saved in the patient's record.

### 📋 Manage Patient Records

You can always manage patient records, such as:
- **View:** by clicking on the eye icon.
- **Edit Conclusion:** by clicking on the conclusion text.
- **Generate PDF Report:** by clicking on the report icon.
